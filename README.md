Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

In my app, I wanted to design a convenient way for people to save events that they need to go to and be able to be notified when events are coming up.
This app was designed to address the users need to keep track of planned events and be notified of these events.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?

The app needed to have a home screen for the user to log in to. This allows the user to keep their events saved on their profile.
There is another page to create an account if need be. Once logged in, the user is introduced to the page where they can create, update, or delete events
There is a button on this page that accesses the notification settings of the app.
Once in the notification settings page, the user can either accept or decline to receive SMS text message reminders.

 How did your UI designs keep users in mind?

In my app, I wanted to keep everything centralized, making it easier for users to read.
I also wanted to use soft colors. I wanted to keep a very simplistic design in this app.

Why were your designs successful?

I believe my designs were successful. I succeeded in using softer colors and keeping pages simple.
I wanted to avoid making an overly complicated application.
The user can log in and do what they need to do without being overwhelmed with an overly complex design.

How did you approach the process of coding your app?

I started from the home page and ensured I set the database up I needed to for the login.
I then ensured that the buttons took the user to the appropriate page. Then, I worked on the new use page.
In this page I ensured the new user would be saved to the database. Also, I ensured the buttons did what they were supposed to do.
Now, on the events page, I did set up a table with an SQLite database. However, I was unable to figure out how to get it to work correctly.
Lastly, I worked on the notification settings page. This page should open if the button is clicked on the events page.

What techniques or strategies did you use?



How could those be applied in the future?



How did you test to ensure your code was functional?



 Why is this process important and what did it reveal?



Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?



In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
